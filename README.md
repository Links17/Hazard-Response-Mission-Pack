# Hazard Response Mission Pack

The Hazard Response Mission Pack is an open-source AIoT solution designed to efficiently manage and mitigate hazard scenarios. This compact system combines a range of technologies, including sensor networks and edge computing, to enable effective remote sensing, data transmission, processing, inference, and analysis.

This initiative is not a market-ready product but rather a collaborative effort between Seeed and a global community of practitioners committed to using technology to tackle real-world challenges. We welcome contributions from individuals and organizations to explore the limitless potential of “tech for hazard response.”
